    <p><em>(Size 1 oz)</em></p>
    <p>Don’t be fooled by the little glass jar - there’s a lot of flowers in here! 95% real flowers. From big petals to tiny petals, and white and pastel colours to vivid royal blue and bright pink. Ranging in all sizes. Many pieces of leaves included to fill in some foliage. I added a few hundred little paper flowers too.</p>
    <p>Use as an In-Lay with Acrylic, Hard Gel, and Hybrid Gel. Can also be used with Suzie's Quick Tips.</p>
    <p><em>Tip</em> — place a bigger flower as a focal point and cut up tiny flowers to fill and place around. Don’t forget the leaves.</p>

      <li>Apply a thin layer of <em>Suzie's Glass Nail</em> all over nail, this will help the next layer settle on to of this layer. Then cure.</li>
      <li>Then, grab a big blob of gel, and gently coat near the cuticle, and let it slowly slide down nail. Add more if needed.</li>
      <li>Don’t forget to hold upside down to let gravity give you a natural apex.</li>
      <li>Once you’re happy with the shape, cure for 60 seconds. Wipe off the dispersion layer, and now you’re ready to sculpt your desired shape.</li>

    <p>EZ Gel is Cruelty Free and HEMA free. Available in Three colours. EZ Gel is creamy and smooth and very easy to control and shape in your favourite nail. Formulated to work with Alcohol.</p>
    <p>You may wonder why I choose to have my Hybrid Gel in Jars/Pots instead of a tube.</p>
    <p>I prefer the jars because I feel it’s easier to get out of the container. Also there is NO WASTE. I can reach <em>every</em> last bead. I found squeezing the tube difficult. You can also put back any unused gel if you just got too much.</p>

    <p><strong>Suzie’s Pink Mix</strong> is specially formulated to be a little opaque and little transparent. Excellent for creating Ombre easily in just two steps. This particular MIX Suzie designed is to cover any natural flaws on the nail. Excellent to fade over the ombre white for that delicate ombre. Use it on the nail plate just before you apply a French smile line, and you’ll see how beautifully the Pink Colour compliments the white or black or any colour you add.</p>

    <h2><em>Super TINY</em> Beads are hard to find!</h2>
    <p>I have created this tiny collection, ready for when you need to add sparkle on your tiny canvas.</p>
    <p>It's a selection of the TINEST beads in the industry. 0.4mm are the Tiniest of all! These super tiny beads are difficult to make, which makes them more expensive and unique. Also included are 0.5mm and 0.6mm.</p>
    <p>These beads add such a level of detail and sophistication. In a cluster, or placed delicately on their own, these help your design stand out. It’s all in the details!</p>
    <h4>How to use</h4>
    <p>When you pour a little amount into your dish (I recommend the <a href="/store/products/gem-catcher">Gem Catcher</a> — it’s designed to easily pour back into jar) you will see the different sizes as the bigger ones sit higher.</p>
    <p>Using a tiny brush, gather a little bit of gel, then place your brush inside the beads to gather several at one time. Then lay them onto your nail by pushing them into place.</p>
    <p>Or if you want to just grab one bead, pick it up with the wax side of the <a href="/store/products/jem-jab">Jem Jab</a> and place onto wet acrylic or gel and then use needle point on <a href="/store/products/jem-jab">Jem Jab</a> to adjust into place.</p>

    <h2>Prepare to prevent lift!</h2>
    <p>To be applied before acrylic application.</p>
    <p>Oils in the nail plate must be eliminated Before application. <em>Let’s Dehydrate</em> will remove oils and cleanse your nail. It helps removes oils and extra moisture to prevent lifting. This is an important step to a no-lift nail.</p>
    <p><em>Let’s Bond</em> acts as an adhesive between your natural nail and the acrylic product you’re going to apply. This product should be applied after <em>Let’s Dehydrate</em>. After you have correctly prepared the nail and removed the dust, gently apply <em>Let’s Bond</em> to the exposed natural nail being careful not to over saturate the natural nail plate. Try not to forget to apply your <em>Let’s Bond</em>, otherwise lifting may occur.</p>
    <p>How to use them together: After you removed cuticle and filed to prepare for application, apply <em>Let’s Dehydrate</em> over entire nail, and always before <em>Let’s Bond</em>.</p>

    <p>The most important tool for a nail tech is their brush. What matters most is its functionality— next to how it looks, of course…</p>
    <p>I've designed this beauty to check both of those boxes! In White and Rose Gold and made with kolinsky, this Oval 8 brush is an ideal size for creating Acrylic nails. I always design my brushes with a cap, which is so important for the longevity of a happy brush!</p>
    <p>Take care of this baby, and this brush will help you create beautiful nails for years to come.</p>
