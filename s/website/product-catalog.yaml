        ***Prepare to prevent lift!***

        To be applied before acrylic application.

        Oils in the nail plate must be eliminated prior to application. Let’s Dehydrate will remove oils and cleanse the nail. It helps remove oils and extra moisture which prevents lifting. This is an important step to a no-lift nail.

        Let’s Bond acts as an adhesive between your natural nail and the acrylic product you’re going to apply. This product should be applied after Let’s Dehydrate. After you have correctly prepared the nail and removed the dust, gently apply Let’s Bond to the exposed natural nail being careful not to over saturate the natural nail plate. Try not to forget to apply your Let’s Bond, otherwise lifting may occur.

        This gel is excellent for those learning how to sculpt gel. It has a thick viscosity gel so that it is slow moving, allowing ample time to create.

        ***Hema Free And Cruelty free***

        How to Use:
        1. Prep the nail and remove any dust.
        1. Apply [BRIDGE](/store/products/bridge) (this product is excellent to bond your gel product with your existing product or for bonding to your natural nail). Don’t forget to cure.
        1. Apply a thin layer of Suzie's Glass Nail all over the nail. This will help the next layer settle on top of this layer. Cure.
        1. Grab a big blob of gel and gently coat near the cuticle. Let it slowly slide down the nail. Add more if needed.
        1. Don’t forget to hold upside down to let gravity give you a natural apex.
        1. Once you’re happy with the shape, cure for 60 seconds. Wipe off the dispersion layer. Now you’re ready to sculpt your desired shape.

        Suzie’s EZ Gel is creamy, smooth, easy to control and shape into your favourite nail and is formulated to work with alcohol.

        Suzie’s EZ Gels come in jars/pots instead of in tubes to make gathering your gel easier and to minimize waste. You can easily scoop any unused/extra gel and place it back in the jar for next time.

        Suzie’s Pink Mix is specially formulated to be a little opaque and a little transparent, making it excellent for creating Ombre easily in just two steps. It’s designed to be opaque enough to cover any natural flaws on the nail, and just translucent enough to fade over the Ombre White for that perfect ombre effect.

        Use this Pink Mix on the nail plate just before you apply a French smile line and you’ll see how beautifully it compliments white, black or any colour you pair it with.

        2 sheets of gold, each 3.25" by 3.25" inches.

        Yes, it’s really 24 K REAL Gold.

        You can apply it in tiny sections, or cover the entire nail. Looks beautiful to accent any design. Add a little 24 K, and take your design from *"nice"* to *"stunning"!*

        **HOW TO USE:**

        - ⚠️ Use clean tweezers (don't touch with fingers!)
        - ⚠️ The gold sheets are very lightweight and delicate — be careful not to fold or crumple them.
        - Using tweezers place gold on nail.
        - Move very slowly when working with this gold.
        - Trim off access with cuticle stick or tweezers.
        - (Optional) Using [Gold Press Brush](/store/products/gold-press-brush), press gently and massage gold to a shine.
        - Once you have achieved the look you want, set your design with ['Reveal' Top Coat](/store/products/reveal-top-coat)

        **Suzie's Nail Art Tool**

        This ‘Jem Jab’ has two functional ends…
        - The wax tip end picks up and releases gems easily onto the nail.
        - The pointy end allows you to delicately adjust your gems.

        This Jem Jab is unique in that its pointy end is particularly tiny, which allows you to adjust the tiniest of gems and beads.

        Easy wipe clean with alcohol if any gel or polish transfers.

        **A little sparkle goes a long way…**

        These Caviar Beads are 0.6mm and 0.4mm small, making them a collection of the tiniest beads in the nail industry. Such small beads are unique and expensive as they are difficult to make. 
        Adding these tiny beads to your designs brings such a level of detail and sophistication. It really is all in the details.

        **How to use**
        1. Pour a small amount into a dish to see the different sized beads. (I recommend the [Gem Catcher](/store/products/gem-catcher) — designed to easily be poured back into jar).
        1. Using a tiny brush, gather a bit of gel and place onto the beads to gather several. Lay them onto your nail by pushing them into place.
        1. Alternatively, to grab one bead, use the wax side of a [Jem Jab](/store/products/jem-jab) and place onto wet acrylic or gel. Then use the pointy end and adjust into place.

        Note: [Jem Jab](/store/products/jem-jab) is not included. [Gem Catcher](/store/products/gem-catcher) is not included. Keep out of reach of children.
