        Three adjustable fingers, and a stand. They pivot and bend, simulating human fingers. Comes with 100 detachable and disposable nail tips.

        **How to use:**
        - Place one of the fingers on the stand.
        - You can detach the reusable tips by snapping it right off of the simulated finger. Simply snap in a new tip.
        - I highly recommend using these practice fingers before you get to work on any humans. Practice your skills and you’ll be much more confident when you’re working with actual fingers

        This tile surface is perfect for mixing and blending gels, soft gels, hybrid gels, or just using the solid surface to use your Jem Jab to collect gemstones. The smooth non-porous surface is so easy to wipe clean.

        **How to use:**
        - Place any type of product on the surface of your tile.
        - Excellent for mixing and grabbing tiny things, like from your gemstones collection, because the surface makes it very easy to pick them up with a tool like the Jem Jab.
        - Wipe with tissue soaked in acetone or alcohol will clean the surface beautifully.

        *Low-odor Formula.*

        I wish I had this product when I first started my career. Slow-Cure will take months or years off your learning curve.

        Slow-Cure is easier to work with, giving you more time to shape the nail before it hardens. Once you create the right bead consistency it almost sculpts itself.

        ***Prepare to prevent lift!***

        To be applied before acrylic application.

        Oils in the nail plate must be eliminated prior to application. Let’s Dehydrate will remove oils and cleanse the nail. It helps remove oils and extra moisture which prevents lifting. This is an important step to a no-lift nail.

        Let’s Bond acts as an adhesive between your natural nail and the acrylic product you’re going to apply. This product should be applied after Let’s Dehydrate. After you have correctly prepared the nail and removed the dust, gently apply Let’s Bond to the exposed natural nail being careful not to over saturate the natural nail plate. Try not to forget to apply your Let’s Bond, otherwise lifting may occur.

        Student Brush Level 2 is an Oval 8 natural hair brush. Natural Hair is optimum for creating acrylic beads. Use the cap/lid provided to keep your natural hair soft and protect the shape.

        ### Usage
        Brush out the packing powder with provided brush- then soak your natural hair brush in your monomer of choice. After creating nails simply make sure any combined product is not left in your brush. Only leave Monomer in your brush, cap it, store placed upside down.

        ### Tips
        - **If product is gathering in your brush**  
          Give it a 15 sec dip in Acetone to remove, and swipe on towel to remove debris. Then submerge in monomer to recondition, slightly drain then cap it.
        - **If product is hardened in your brush**  
          Then soak in Acetone for 5 mins or longer if needed. Once unwanted product is gone, soak in monomer to recondition, slightly drain, then cap it.

        *Student Brush Level 1: Synthetic* is Suzie's oval #6 brush.

        Excellent for learning acrylic especially with Low Odour Monomer. Synthetic hairs are much less absorbent. So makes working with monomers easier to create perfect beads, because it holds less monomer.

        Always store with the cap on, to keep the brush soft for your next usage.

        **How to Use:**
        - This gold beauty holds much less monomer than natural hair brushes. If you've had issues in the past with runny beads, then this might be the brush for you!
        - After use, roll to make sure no product is stuck in bristles.
        - Clean this brush with ALCOHOL ONLY.
        - Keep in mind, acetone will destroy hairs.

        This 100% Kolinsky acrylic brush is the most important tool in the professional nail technician's collection. Take care of this brush, and it will take care of you.

        This brush holds the perfect amount of liquid, and maintains its shape while sculpting and building. It comes to a fine point for those crispy French edges when you need it.

        **How to use:**
        - When you first receive your new acrylic brush, you'll want to gently remove the packing powder that keeps its shape during shipping. Use the supplied black brush to gently brush toward the tip to get rid of this powder. Next soak your brush, without fraying or disturbing the hairs, into a dappen dish with monomer.
        - If you get product stuck and dried in the brush, soak it in acetone for just a few minutes to release the product and clean it out, and then condition the brush in monomer. Make sure you gently roll in one direction on a paper towel to make a point and use the cap to keep the bristles soft.

        This set comes with five versatile nail art brushes of various sizes and lengths, which are excellent for hand-painting expressive details on the nail.
        - Extra Long Liner Use this brush to make your line work quicker and easier.
        - Long Liner Create swirls and flowing lines in one swoop. Also great for creating flowers; using a little pressure to create a petal.
        - Marbleizer This brush will help you "marbleize" lines. With different pressures on bristles, create varying width of lines you need for a marble effect.
        - Writing Detailer Use this brush for handwriting. When there's something to say, say it with style!
        - Highlight Detailer When you need a tiny line, highlight, or maybe an eyelash or eyebrow.

        I love this bit for getting into the tiny spots. It’s excellent for trimming off fine over spill of product.

        For example if you have hardened Acrylic or hard gel or gel polish flooding into the cuticle, this tiny bit can get in there to remover this over spill with out ruining your gel polish.

        Also excellent for fine tuning extra product from  underneath the free edge. Also excellent for gently buffing product around cuticle for a smooth effect near cuticle.

        - Strong Tungsten Carbide will last years.
        - Fits 3/32 e-files.

        Naturally Fake is your answer to Natural looking Nails. I spent months creating this creamy formula to simulate natural nails. It’s hard to grow natural nails when your hands are so busy and exposed to the elements, it’s hard on nails, but Naturally Fake will change all that. No one is gonna know 😉

        Pair with [Suzie's Pink EZ Gel](/store/products/ez-gel-pink-mix), specially formulated with just enough opacity to cover flaws but still translucent to match the natural nail bed. A beautiful colour to compliment all skin tones.

        This gel is excellent for those learning how to sculpt gel. It has a thick viscosity gel so that it is slow moving, allowing ample time to create.

        ***Hema Free And Cruelty free***

        How to Use:
        1. Prep the nail and remove any dust.
        1. Apply [BRIDGE](/store/products/bridge) (this product is excellent to bond your gel product with your existing product or for bonding to your natural nail). Don’t forget to cure.
        1. Apply a thin layer of Suzie's Glass Nail all over the nail. This will help the next layer settle on top of this layer. Cure.
        1. Grab a big blob of gel and gently coat near the cuticle. Let it slowly slide down the nail. Add more if needed.
        1. Don’t forget to hold upside down to let gravity give you a natural apex.
        1. Once you’re happy with the shape, cure for 60 seconds. Wipe off the dispersion layer. Now you’re ready to sculpt your desired shape.

        Suzie’s EZ Gels come in jars/pots instead of in tubes to make gathering your gel easier and to minimize waste. You can easily scoop any unused/extra gel and place it back in the jar for next time.

        Suzie’s Pink Mix is specially formulated to be a little opaque and a little transparent, making it excellent for creating Ombre easily in just two steps. It’s designed to be opaque enough to cover any natural flaws on the nail, and just translucent enough to fade over the Ombre White for that perfect ombre effect.

        Use this Pink Mix on the nail plate just before you apply a French smile line and you’ll see how beautifully it compliments white, black or any colour you pair it with.

        Inlay into any product or nail product your working with. Add to Hard Gel, Acrylic, Hybrid Gel,  Gel Polish & Nail Polish. Simply apply to freshly applied product for an inlay and cap.

        For Nail Polish or Gel Polish simply lay glitter on top of wet product. Let dry or cure and put a topcoat over top.

        ***PRO TIP*** — put two coats of topcoat to make it smoother if pieces stick up at all.

        Combine more colours together to create even more designs.

        2 sheets of gold, each 3.25" by 3.25" inches.

        Yes, it’s really 24 K REAL Gold.

        You can apply it in tiny sections, or cover the entire nail. Looks beautiful to accent any design. Add a little 24 K, and take your design from *"nice"* to *"stunning"!*

        **HOW TO USE:**

        - ⚠️ Use clean tweezers (don't touch with fingers!)
        - ⚠️ The gold sheets are very lightweight and delicate — be careful not to fold or crumple them.
        - Using tweezers place gold on nail.
        - Move very slowly when working with this gold.
        - Trim off access with cuticle stick or tweezers.
        - (Optional) Using [Gold Press Brush](/store/products/gold-press-brush), press gently and massage gold to a shine.
        - Once you have achieved the look you want, set your design with ['Reveal' Top Coat](/store/products/reveal-top-coat)

        **Suzie's Nail Art Tool**

        This ‘Jem Jab’ has two functional ends…
        - The wax tip end picks up and releases gems easily onto the nail.
        - The pointy end allows you to delicately adjust your gems.

        This Jem Jab is unique in that its pointy end is particularly tiny, which allows you to adjust the tiniest of gems and beads.

        Easy wipe clean with alcohol if any gel or polish transfers.

        **A little sparkle goes a long way…**

        These Caviar Beads are 0.6mm and 0.4mm small, making them a collection of the tiniest beads in the nail industry. Such small beads are unique and expensive as they are difficult to make. 
        Adding these tiny beads to your designs brings such a level of detail and sophistication. It really is all in the details.

        **How to use**
        1. Pour a small amount into a dish to see the different sized beads. (I recommend the [Gem Catcher](/store/products/gem-catcher) — designed to easily be poured back into jar).
        1. Using a tiny brush, gather a bit of gel and place onto the beads to gather several. Lay them onto your nail by pushing them into place.
        1. Alternatively, to grab one bead, use the wax side of a [Jem Jab](/store/products/jem-jab) and place onto wet acrylic or gel. Then use the pointy end and adjust into place.

        Note: [Jem Jab](/store/products/jem-jab) is not included. [Gem Catcher](/store/products/gem-catcher) is not included. Keep out of reach of children.
