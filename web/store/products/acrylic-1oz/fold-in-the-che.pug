	<p>A soft coloured powder for a delicate design. The velvety texture blends perfectly with Suzie's Monomers. Comes in a reusable glass jar with a natural cork stopper.</p>
	<p>You can use this acrylic powder on its own, or blend it with other acrylic colours to make your own custom colours. Blend with Suzie's soft white to create a marble â€” or blend the clear acrylic to make a transparent shade of each colour.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Store in a cool dark place</li>
		<li>Keep away from children</li>
		<li>Colours can look different on devices, so they may appear different in-person</li>
	</ul>
