block writeup
	<h2>Nuke it with Suzie!</h2>
	<p>I personally designed this apron to protect clothing from spills, splatters and dust. I also designed it to look really cute!</p>
	<p>I added a front pocket to hold your phone, or your files, or whatever!</p>
	<p><em>Each order comes with two aprons</em></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Crisp eggshell-white waffle cotton hides nail dust</li>
		<li>Piped lining for a finished look</li>
		<li>Front pocket for easy tool/accessory access</li>
		<li>Goes with anything you wear!</li>
	</ul>
